        Hi! I'm a 3rd-year Information Technology student with a strong passion
        for both tech and public service. I'm a web developer specializing in
        JavaScript, React, and Django â€” creating web applications that are
        responsive, efficient, and user-friendly. Alongside my studies, I'm
        actively involved in the ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps), where
        I'm building leadership skills and discipline. I plan to pursue a career
        in a police center while also continuing to grow as a web developer. I
        believe in using both technology and service to make a real impact on
        people's lives. Whether it's coding full-stack applications or
        contributing to my community, I'm driven by purpose, learning, and the
        desire to build a better future.
      </p>
