        Hello, I'm Oshie Mikomi Sato, a third-year college student with a
        passion for frontend development. I’m currently honing my skills in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. My goal is to
        create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces that deliver
        seamless experiences. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and
        improve my craft, and I’m excited to apply my growing expertise in
        real-world projects. I’m looking forward to contributing to innovative
        projects and collaborating with teams to build the web of tomorrow.
